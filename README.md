# Rollback Atomic Ball

This is an online game made during the Networking module at SAE Institute.
It is an online version of [Atomic Ball](https://fabianhbr.ch/projects/atomic-ball/) with fewer features.

The project was made in one month using C++, SFML and a rollback engine provided by my teacher that is documented here : https://eliasfarhan.github.io/rollback_doc/.
